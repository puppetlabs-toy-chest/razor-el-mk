# doesn't work running from source; OTOH, this doesn't work if we *are*
# installed such that mk is on RUBYLIB, but we are in, eg, `/usr/bin`...
#
# So many ways this can go wrong. This seems the least-worst compromise to me.

usage: mk <command> [...]

Invoke an MK script command, and exit.  Available commands:

 * register

Register this node with the Razor server.  This submits facts and, if the
server has an action to be carried out, executes it locally.

 * execute <command> [args...]

Execute a Razor command.  This is used to run commands returned by the Razor
server, but could also be used to locally test custom commands.
