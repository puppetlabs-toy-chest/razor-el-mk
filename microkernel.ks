# In order to have network connections managed effectively, we use
# NetworkManager.  This is ~ 5.9MB of space in the image, but it also means
# that we are (A) using the recommended and default upstream configuration,
# and (B) no longer responsible for doing all the network management
# ourselves.  This is, overall, a big win for everyone.
#
# Also, this opens the door to allowing for more complex configurations such
# as 802.1x secured network links, VPN connectivity for communication with the
# host, and so forth -- should we decide we need it.
#
# Ultimately, though, that as the upstream project write:
#
#    "Fedora now by default relies on NetworkManager for network
#     configuration. This is the case also for minimal installations and server
#     installations. We are trying to make NetworkManager as suitable for this
#     task as possible."

# I hope that doesn't offend.  Dropping this in just works! --daniel 2013-11-07
