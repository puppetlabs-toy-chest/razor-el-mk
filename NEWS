005 - 2014-05-20
  * support downloading an extension.zip for custom and external facts
  * use Facter 2.0.1
  * Fix dracut could not boot error by patching initrd (RAZOR-170)
  * Add dmidecode and virt-what (RAZOR-145)

004 - 2014-01-30
  * build-livecd-root: better control when temp dir is cleaned
  * microkernel.ks: blacklist mei and mei_me

003 - 2013-11-21
  * Use NetworkManager for configuring/bringing up networking
  * Add net-tools (ifconfig) so that facter reports on network devices

002 - 2013-10-28
  * Pull in latest Facter from Puppetlabs repos, rather than the one from
    Fedora. That immediately pulls in a number of useful facts, like
    blockdevice_* or memorysize_mb
  * Always build based on Fedora 19, regardless of the Fedora version
    running on the build machine
  * Greatly reduce the image size by pruning lots of unneeded packages and
    data files; reduces size from ~ 200 MB to ~ 150 MB
  * Disable SSH daemon by default; to reenable, log into the console and
    run 'systemctl start sshd.service'
  * DHCP all the things: the microkernel will try and bring up every
    physical interface via DHCP

001 - 2013-08-28
  * Initial release of the Fedora-based Microkernel
  * Completely rewritten MK agent
