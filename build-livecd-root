This is a Microkernel for the new Razor
(https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server)

The microkernel was built from https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-el-mk
at commit $last_tag

For instructions on how to set things up, read
https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server/wiki/Installation

To verify the kernel and initrd in this tar, run

  sha256sum -c SHA256SUM

The SHA256SUM file is signed with my public key (FC6E8A22). You can verify it
by running

  gpg --verify SHA256SUM.sig
EOF

sha256sum initrd0.img vmlinuz0 > SHA256SUM

cd ..
tarball=$srcdir/pkg/microkernel-${last_tag#release-}.tar
tar cf $tarball microkernel/
chown --reference $srcdir/build-livecd $tarball

echo "* Done"
echo "The microkernel is in $tarball"
